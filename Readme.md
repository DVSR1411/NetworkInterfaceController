Py-NIC

My project is to create a program that can enable or disable the network interface controller (NIC) of a computer. The NIC is a hardware component that connects a computer to a computer network and allows computers to communicate over a network using cables or wirelessly. The program should be able to turn on or off the NIC, which is implemented using a specific physical layer and data link layer standard such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi. The NIC can be built into the motherboard of the computer or contained in a USB-connected dongle. Modern NICs offer advanced features such as interrupt and DMA interfaces to the host processors, support for multiple receive and transmit queues, partitioning into multiple logical interfaces, and on-controller network traffic processing such as the TCP offload engine.
