# Py-NIC

Py-NIC is a project aimed at creating a program capable of enabling or disabling the Network Interface Controller (NIC) of a computer. The NIC is a vital hardware component responsible for connecting a computer to a network, facilitating communication over cables or wirelessly.

## Overview

The program's primary functionality is to toggle the state of the NIC, enabling or disabling it as required. This capability is crucial for various scenarios, including network troubleshooting, security enforcement, or power-saving measures.

## Features

- **NIC Control**: Enable or disable the NIC based on user input.
- **Support for Various Standards**: The program supports a range of physical layer and data link layer standards such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
- **Flexibility**: Works with NICs built into the motherboard or contained in USB-connected dongles.
- **Advanced NIC Features**: Modern NICs often offer advanced features like interrupt and DMA interfaces, support for multiple queues, logical interface partitioning, and on-controller network traffic processing.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to control network interfaces.
3. Run the program and follow the on-screen prompts to enable or disable the NIC.

## Future Improvements

- **Graphical User Interface**: Implement a user-friendly GUI for easier interaction.
- **Enhanced Compatibility**: Improve compatibility with a wider range of NIC models and standards.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected scenarios.
- **Additional Features**: Explore adding features like NIC status monitoring and bandwidth management.
